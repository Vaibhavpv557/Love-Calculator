# Love-Calculator
A fun Python project to calculate your "love compatibility"!
Who says coding can’t be romantic?
I just built a Love Calculator using Python — a light-hearted console app that adds a little twist of fun to programming.

Using simple string logic and a bit of math, this project was all about blending creativity with code. Whether you're coding for fun or for love, Python always delivers!

Try it with your name and your crush’s… and see what destiny (or the algorithm) says!

Tech Stack: Python, Random, String Logic
